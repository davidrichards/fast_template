Humane Coding
=============

I haven't heard people talk a lot about humane coding. People build systems, and if we wear those out, things get ugly. Working in cycles recognized that we need to be prepared for work, work a moderate amount of time with even-sized tasks, and leave work in an easy to resume state.

Preparing to Work

I like to start coding in a good state. For me, this has little to do with clock on the wall. Rather, I develop opinions about sleep, caffeine, food, noise, task preparation, expectations, and anything else that's likely to disrupt a good session. 

A good session can be an order of magnitude more productive than an average one. However, I don't often care if it's going to be productive, but I always care if it's going to be frustrating. If I can't concentrate, finish what I start, or communicate where I am, then everything becomes more difficult and the pressure builds. Bad things happen in this state.

Better to learn to start well than to allow anyone to blame me for natural things that could get in my way. I am someone too. Better to not blame myself for these problems.

Here's what I do now:

* I maintain a personal kanban with a backlog of everything asked of me, including non-coding tasks. This relieves pressure from other areas of my life when I want to spend a few minutes coding--there's no reason to stop a session if I know I'm going to schedule the dentist appointment soon.
* I maintain a small WIP, usually 2 or 3 items max. This offers an opportunity to leave everything else alone for a while.
* I visualize and celebrate progress.
* I maintain questions. I always finish a session with questions that I want to answer before coding again. I start a coding session by reviewing the questions, commenting on them, and deciding if I am clear enough to begin work.

When tasks are unevenly sized, they can be harder to complete. Imagine starting an "easy" task and walking away from it hours later unfinished. Restarting that task is nearly impossible. I don't mind 1-minute tasks, but I definitely mind them if they are likely going to take more than 20 minutes to complete.

Hidden blockers occur when I thought a task was finishable, but there are issues I didnt' understand. This is usually a training problem, but it can also come from architectural confusion or other sources of confusion. The simplest solution is to break a blocked task into more tasks. Never come back to a blocked task as if I could force it to behave the next time.

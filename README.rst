=============
fast_tutorial
=============


    Build a FastAPI application using conventional Python and layered architecture.


There are a lot of resources I've used to get my projects running:

* Docker containers: start with deployment in mind.
* Tests: always a good idea to test-drive anything.
* Sphinx: for documentation.
* Tox: for testing, building, deploying, and more.
* Makefile and local scripts: for running common tasks.
* Layered architecture: for keeping the code testable and maintainable.

If I can remember what the standard way to use these are, that would be wonderful. Since I can't, I wrote a tutorial to learn the material more deeply and leave a reference for later.
